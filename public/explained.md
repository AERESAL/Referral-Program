## What if they don’t know how to code?

No problem at all. Daydream Omaha is beginner-friendly.  
We will host workshops that teach attendees how to code and even publish their own game on [itch.io](https://itch.io). Everyone is welcome, no experience needed.

Only if they have not been referred yet. If they registered without a referral, they may be able to edit their signup to include your code. Check with the organizers.
